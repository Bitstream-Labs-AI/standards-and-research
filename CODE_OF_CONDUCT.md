In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we, the contributors and maintainers of the **Standards and Research in AI Benchmarking** repository, pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free and inclusive experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

### 2. Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contribute to a positive environment include:

* **Demonstrating empathy and kindness** toward other people.
* **Being respectful** of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences.
* **Giving and gracefully accepting** constructive feedback.
* **Focusing on what is best** for the community and the project.
* **Using inclusive language** and clear, respectful communication.

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* **The use of sexualized language or imagery** and unwelcome sexual attention or advances.
* **Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments**, and personal or political attacks.
* **Public or private harassment.**

### 3. Enforcement Responsibilities

The Project Maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Project Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, and to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate.

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, and also applies when an individual is representing the project or its community in public spaces. Examples of representing our project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

### 5. Reporting and Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the project team responsible for enforcement at **[conduct@bitstreamlabs.ai](mailto:conduct@bitstreamlabs.ai)**.
