## 🔬 Standards and Research in AI Benchmarking

Welcome to the **Standards and Research in AI Benchmarking** repository.

### 🌟 Introduction

The rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) requires rigorous, standardized, and reproducible methods for performance evaluation. This repository serves as a central, community-driven resource to track, discuss, and disseminate critical information related to the **standards, research, and best practices** underpinning AI benchmarking.

Our goal is to foster a shared understanding of the methodologies used to assess AI capabilities across various domains, including machine learning models, hardware accelerators, and specific application areas (e.g., natural language processing, computer vision, robotics). All content contributed to and maintained in this repository is governed by the **Mozilla Public License 2.0 (MPL-2.0)**.

### 🎯 What You Will Find Here

* **Standards Tracking:** Information and links related to active and proposed international standards (e.g., from IEEE, ISO/IEC, MLPerf, SPEC) that govern AI testing and benchmarking.
* **Research Summaries:** Curated lists and summaries of seminal or recent academic papers focusing on the **validity, fairness, reliability, and methodology** of AI performance metrics.
* **Methodology Deep Dives:** Resources that break down complex benchmarking techniques, such as adversarial robustness testing, data efficiency metrics, and energy consumption standards.
* **Tooling & Frameworks:** A non-exhaustive list of open-source tools and frameworks designed for automated AI performance measurement and comparison.
